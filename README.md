# CNN_Pitch_tracking

This is an implementation on convolutional neural network for pitch estimation application.
The neural net consist of 3 convolution layers and 1 fully-connected layers.
The available frequency range is 4 ocvates range (C2-B6 in equal temperament tuning) with 50 cents interval
These codes are part of my senior project, please do not modify anything.
